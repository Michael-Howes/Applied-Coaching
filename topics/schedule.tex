\section{Syllabus}

\begin{itemize}
	\item There is no required homework for this course, but it is recommended that you do the 2011-2022 applied qualifying exams for practice.
	\item Each session will have two parts. First we will review a topic. Next we will discuss the solutions to a particular year's qual.
	\item A tentative schedule is shown in Table \ref{table:schedule}. I'll update this schedule. We'll have to re-schedule one of the classes because of the Fourth of July holiday. The topics can also be adjusted based on your preferences.
	\item In the two weeks before your exams, you should take the 2022 quals in exam conditions. We'll schedule a time to go over the applied exam together.
	\item Many of you will find that you don't have time to fully write up solutions to every past qual you are asked to do.  This is ok, but you will get a lot of reading every exam and at least writing down a sketch of the answer. 
	\item I will update this document as we go along. I will follow Dan Kluger's notes which are already on Canvas.
\end{itemize}
